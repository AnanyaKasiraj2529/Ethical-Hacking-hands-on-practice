# 🔐 SSH Honeypot – Python-Based Threat Capture System

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a custom SSH Honeypot using Python and the `paramiko` library.  
The honeypot simulates an SSH server and captures unauthorized login attempts, credentials, and attacker behavior for defensive security research.

This project demonstrates:

- SSH protocol emulation
- Logging architecture
- Credential harvesting detection
- Threat monitoring in a controlled lab

# 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

## Step 1 — Update System
```bash
sudo apt update
```
## Step 2 — Install Python Virtual Environment Support
```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv -y
```
## Step 3 — Create Project Directory
```bash
mkdir SSH_Honeypot
cd SSH_Honeypot
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
## Must be able to see: (venv) user@kali:~/SSH_Honeypot$
## Requirements - pip install paramiko

🚀 Running the SSH Honeypot
sudo python honeypot.py
## Expected output: [+] SSH Honeypot running on port 2222

🧪 Testing the Honeypot
Open a second terminal and simulate an attacker:
ssh attacker@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
Enter any password when prompted.

The connection will close after the attempt.
