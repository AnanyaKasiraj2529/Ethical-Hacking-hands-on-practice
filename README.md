# 🔐 Cybersecurity Portfolio – Offensive & Defensive Projects

This repository contains practical cybersecurity projects focused on threat simulation, automated reconnaissance, and exposure risk analysis.

All testing was conducted in controlled lab environments using intentionally vulnerable systems.

## 📂 Projects

### 1️⃣ SSH Honeypot (Defensive Security)

A custom-built Python SSH honeypot that simulates an SSH service and captures:

- Unauthorized login attempts
- Username/password harvesting
- Command execution attempts
- Attacker IP logging

📁 Folder: `ssh-honeypot/`

Technologies:
- Python
- Paramiko
- Socket programming
- Log-based threat analysis

---

### 2️⃣ Automated Reconnaissance & Risk Scoring Framework (Offensive Security)

A modular Python reconnaissance engine that automates:

- Port scanning
- Service detection
- Exposure analysis
- Risk classification
- JSON report generation

Tested against Metasploitable 2 in a controlled lab environment.

📁 Folder: `Automated-Recon-Framework/`

Technologies:
- Python
- Nmap
- python-nmap
- Shodan API
- Modular architecture

---

## 🧪 Lab Validation

Projects were tested using:

- Kali Linux (Attacker)
- Metasploitable 2 (Vulnerable Target)
- NAT-based isolated network

No unauthorized scanning of external systems was performed.

---
